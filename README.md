# Pollito-Fresh-Install
This is a version of a program I created in order to make a fresh image installation faster. (No longer being used)

I created this in order to give a graphical user interface to the user to pick and choose what they would like to install.

This was created as an update to the batch files Sys Update(V1 + V2) and Fresh Install (V1 + V2)
